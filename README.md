# Coding Practice: Introduction to Loops

This repository contains examples and exercises for practicing loops in C++.

## Examples

1. **Calculate the Sum**: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a range-based for loop.
2. **Find the Factorial**: Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.
3. **Guess the Number Game**: Implement a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number using a do-while loop.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the examples, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

### Running the Examples

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Execute the `run.sh` script:

    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

This script will compile the `main.cpp` file and execute the resulting executable.
